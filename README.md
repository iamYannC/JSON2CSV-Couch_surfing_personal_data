# Couchsurfing Personal Data Web Application, from JSON to CSV

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this web application is to provide a user-friendly interface to the personal data file the Couchsurfing website provides to its users. The application is built using the Shiny framework in R. The application is hosted on shinyapps.io and can be accessed [here](https://yannco.shinyapps.io/cs_personal_data/).

I do not keep any of the data that a user uploades to the application. The data is only used to generate the csv files, for the user to download and analyse themselves.

Please contact me if you have any questions or suggestions,
